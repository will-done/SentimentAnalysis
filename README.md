# Data Preprocessing

In the Data Cleaning process, URLs, user tags (@user), special characters and stop words were cleaned from tweet texts.

Each tweet was labeled as positive or negative using sentiment analysis tools.

Emotion scores (e.g., a value between 1 and 0) were calculated and added to the dataset.

# Result
